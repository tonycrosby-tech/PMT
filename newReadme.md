1. Task Management
Frontend:

Create a task list component with Tailwind CSS for styling.
Use React state to manage tasks (e.g., useContext or Redux for global state management).
Build forms for creating and editing tasks.

Backend:

Set up a REST API with endpoints for CRUD operations on tasks.
Use MongoDB to store tasks, with fields for title, description, assignee, due date, and priority.
2. Project Overview
Frontend:

Design a dashboard component displaying project statistics and progress.
Use charts or visual components (e.g., React Chart.js) to illustrate data.
Backend:

Create endpoints to fetch project data and statistics from MongoDB.
Implement aggregation queries for summary data (e.g., task completion rates).
3. Collaboration Tools
Frontend:

Add comment functionality under each task using a separate component.
Implement file upload features using libraries like React Dropzone.
Backend:

Create endpoints for posting and retrieving comments.
Use GridFS or similar in MongoDB for file storage and linking to tasks.
4. Time Tracking
Frontend:

Build a timer component for logging hours spent on tasks.
Create a form for users to enter time estimates.
Backend:

Implement endpoints to log hours and retrieve time tracking data for tasks.
Store time entries in MongoDB with references to the corresponding tasks.
5. Notifications and Reminders
Frontend:

Use state to manage notifications and display them in a notification dropdown.
Implement a reminder feature with input fields for setting notifications.
Backend:

Use a scheduling library (e.g., Node-cron) to send reminders.
Store user preferences for notifications in MongoDB.
6. User Roles and Permissions
Frontend:

Create a user management interface for admins to assign roles.
Use context or state to conditionally render components based on user roles.
Backend:

Implement user authentication and authorization with JWT.
Set up role-based access controls in your API endpoints.
7. Simple Reporting
Frontend:

Design a reporting page with filters for different criteria (e.g., date range, project).
Use tables or charts to display report data.
Backend:

Create endpoints to fetch report data and generate simple analytics.
Use MongoDB aggregation framework for complex queries.
8. Search and Filtering
Frontend:

Implement a search bar and filtering options within the task list.
Use React hooks to manage search queries and filter tasks dynamically.
Backend:

Create an endpoint to query tasks based on search and filter criteria.
Use MongoDB queries to support filtering by status, assignee, or due date.
9. Integration Options
Frontend:

Build settings or integrations page to manage third-party connections.
Use environment variables to manage API keys securely.
Backend:

Implement API routes for integrating with external services (like Google Calendar).
Handle OAuth or API key authentication as needed for integrations.
10. Mobile Accessibility
Frontend:

Use responsive design principles with Tailwind CSS.
Ensure components adapt well to different screen sizes.
Backend:

Maintain a consistent API that works well for both web and mobile requests.
Consider using progressive web app (PWA) techniques for a mobile-friendly experience.
Development Workflow
Planning: Define user stories and prioritize features.
Design: Create wireframes and mockups using tools like Figma.
Setup: Initialize your React app with Tailwind CSS, set up MongoDB, and configure the backend.
Iterative Development: Use Agile methodology to build and test features incrementally.
Testing: Implement unit tests for components and integration tests for the backend.
Deployment: Use platforms like Heroku or Vercel for deployment and ensure CI/CD pipelines are in place.
